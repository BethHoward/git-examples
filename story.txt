Chapter 0 (the beginning):
Once upon a time . . . on a dark and stormy night - some shit happened
We were at Code Fellows, and the Christmas lights were already up, 
even though Halloween was only a couple days ago. Also, we haven't
had any turkey yet!! Where are the pumpkins?

Chapter 2 (THERE IS NO CHAPTER 1!!)
As you may recall from chapter one . . . wait . . . you don't remember chapter
one? weren't you paying attention?
